      <description>The number of households that participate in the Covington curbside recycling program has grown tremendously in the last eight years.
Here are the numbers by neighborhood. Numbers represent the percentage of households who contract for trash pickup that also use a recycling cart. Notice that every single neighborhood has increased over this period.
The recycling program carries no additional cost beyond the annual trash collection fee.
In all, some 2,410 tons of recyclable material was diverted from landfills in Fiscal Year 2024.</description>
