      <description>Since 2017 the Covington Police Department has responded to an average of 54,241 service calls each year (as of July, 2023). A small part of the service that the Covingotn Police provide is to respond when a person is in need of assistance in a motor vehicleâ€“for example, if they are out of gas, stranded on the interstate, have a flat tire, or need a wrecker, etc. From January 2021 to July 2023, the Covington Police responded to 2,887 calls for assistance by a motorist within the City of Covington.</description>
