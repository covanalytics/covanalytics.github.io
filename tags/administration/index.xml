      <description>There have been four economic recessions in the United States since the early 1990s. A recession is a significant, widespread, and prolonged downturn in economic activity, and is typically identified by two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth.1 One of the most noticeable effects of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which usually peaks long after the recession has begun and can last well into recovery.</description>

      <description>Any event (i.e.Â festival, concert, run/walk, art show, etc.) that uses, or will likely have a large impact on public or City-owned property, such as streets or parks, requires a Special Event Permit Application. This is information that the City of Covington requires to ensure that everything goes smoothly and safely with the event.
Some events, naturally, last longer than others. What kind of world would this be if we only have one day to enjoy the Rockin Taco Fest?</description>
