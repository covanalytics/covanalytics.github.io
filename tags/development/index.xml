      <description>What does a house cost in The Cov?
Depends (greatly) on where you look.
With the affordability of housing a frequent topic of conversation these days, the City of Covington’s analytics manager took a dive into 2023 sales by neighborhood and found a wide range of prices, with a few outliers.
The median sales price in 13 of the 23 neighborhoods was less than $200,000. In seven neighborhoods, it was $161,000 or less.</description>

      <description>The median household income in Covington in 2009 was $38,700. By 2022, that number had grown to $53,800 – an increase of $15,100. Other Kentucky cities of similar size – such as Bowling Green, Elizabethtown, Hopkinsville, Owensboro, and Richmond – showed similar growth in that 13-year period, according to data from the American Community Survey (ACS) from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Why is this important? Household income not only improves an individual family’s buying power but is also considered a valuable measure of the relative economic well-being of a city.</description>

      <description>In a previous post we briefly looked at where Covington residents work within the Cincinnati-Wilmington-Maysville Combined Statistical Area (CSA) using the most recent LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) dataset for the year 2020. The dataset links home and work locations at the census block-level, making it easy to answer questions about where people work and where workers live.
In this post, we look briefly at where people working in Covington live within the Cincinnati-Wilmington-Maysville CSA.</description>

      <description>The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program is part of the Center for Economic Studies at the U.S. Census Bureau. The LEHD program produces cost effective, public-use information combining federal, state and Census Bureau data on employers and employees under the Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership. State and local authorities increasingly need detailed local information about their economies to make informed decisions. The LED Partnership works to fill critical data gaps and provide indicators needed by state and local authorities.</description>

      <description>There have been four economic recessions in the United States since the early 1990s. A recession is a significant, widespread, and prolonged downturn in economic activity, and is typically identified by two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth.1 One of the most noticeable effects of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which usually peaks long after the recession has begun and can last well into recovery.</description>

      <description>The Planning and Development Services of Kenton County (PDS) provides the City of Covington with data containing details on every building permit issued in Covington, including the type of work planned for a property and how much the work is expected to cost. Figure 1 shows that the installation of solar panels is a particular property enhancement that has become increasingly popular in recent years. In the last two years alone, interest in solar panels has jumped considerably, with owners of 74 properties in Covington completing the necessary paperwork to have solar panels installed—work valued at an estimated $1.</description>

      <description>Each year the City of Covington receives a tax assessment report from the Kenton County Property Value Administrator that determines the taxable value of real property in the City, specifically for the purpose of levying and collecting tax money that is used to support the community. Included in the report is a record of taxable additions to property. The additions, basically, represent economic investment through the development of new property or through the enhancement of existing property.</description>
