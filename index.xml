      <description>The median household income in Covington in 2009 was $38,700. By 2022, that number had grown to $53,800 – an increase of $15,100. Other Kentucky cities of similar size – such as Bowling Green, Elizabethtown, Hopkinsville, Owensboro, and Richmond – showed similar growth in that 13-year period, according to data from the American Community Survey (ACS) from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Why is this important? Household income not only improves an individual family’s buying power but is also considered a valuable measure of the relative economic well-being of a city.</description>

      <description>There is a widely held belief that police are busier during a full moon. Why do people believe this? Perhaps the gravitational forces of the full moon cause cyclic fluid shifts between body compartments and thereby trigger emotional disturbances leading to more aggressive and erratic behaviors.1 Or perhaps there is a scintilla of truth to the mythology of the ancient Greeks and Romans and humans actually turn into wolves during the full moon….</description>

      <description>Since 2017 the Covington Police Department has responded to an average of 54,241 service calls each year (as of July, 2023). A small part of the service that the Covington Police provide is to respond when a person is in need of assistance in a motor vehicle–for example, if they are out of gas, stranded on the interstate, have a flat tire, or need a wrecker, etc. From January 2021 to July 2023, the Covington Police responded to 2,887 calls for assistance by a motorist within the City of Covington.</description>

      <description>In a previous post we briefly looked at where Covington residents work within the Cincinnati-Wilmington-Maysville Combined Statistical Area (CSA) using the most recent LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) dataset for the year 2020. The dataset links home and work locations at the census block-level, making it easy to answer questions about where people work and where workers live.
In this post, we look briefly at where people working in Covington live within the Cincinnati-Wilmington-Maysville CSA.</description>

      <description>The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program is part of the Center for Economic Studies at the U.S. Census Bureau. The LEHD program produces cost effective, public-use information combining federal, state and Census Bureau data on employers and employees under the Local Employment Dynamics (LED) Partnership. State and local authorities increasingly need detailed local information about their economies to make informed decisions. The LED Partnership works to fill critical data gaps and provide indicators needed by state and local authorities.</description>

      <description>There have been four economic recessions in the United States since the early 1990s. A recession is a significant, widespread, and prolonged downturn in economic activity, and is typically identified by two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth.1 One of the most noticeable effects of a recession is a rise in unemployment, which usually peaks long after the recession has begun and can last well into recovery.</description>

      <description>Any event (i.e. festival, concert, run/walk, art show, etc.) that uses, or will likely have a large impact on public or City-owned property, such as streets or parks, requires a Special Event Permit Application. This is information that the City of Covington requires to ensure that everything goes smoothly and safely with the event.
Some events, naturally, last longer than others. What kind of world would this be if we only have one day to enjoy the Rockin Taco Fest?</description>

      <description>The Planning and Development Services of Kenton County (PDS) provides the City of Covington with data containing details on every building permit issued in Covington, including the type of work planned for a property and how much the work is expected to cost. Figure 1 shows that the installation of solar panels is a particular property enhancement that has become increasingly popular in recent years. In the last two years alone, interest in solar panels has jumped considerably, with owners of 74 properties in Covington completing the necessary paperwork to have solar panels installed—work valued at an estimated $1.</description>

      <description>The website for the City of Covington is visited by people from all over the United States, and world. With the help of Google Analytics, the City is able to monitor all of the website pages and gain insights into visitor activity, such as the number of visitors, most viewed pages, device types, and much more.
In Figure 1, for example, we can see where returning visits to the City of Covington website on a mobile device originated by state and city in the last 100 days.</description>

      <description>Each year the City of Covington receives a tax assessment report from the Kenton County Property Value Administrator that determines the taxable value of real property in the City, specifically for the purpose of levying and collecting tax money that is used to support the community. Included in the report is a record of taxable additions to property. The additions, basically, represent economic investment through the development of new property or through the enhancement of existing property.</description>
