What does a house cost in The Cov? 
 
Depends (greatly) on where you look.
 
With the affordability of housing a frequent topic of conversation these days, the City of Covington’s analytics manager took a dive into 2023 sales by neighborhood and found a wide range of prices, with a few outliers.
 
The median sales price in 13 of the 23 neighborhoods was less than $200,000.  In seven neighborhoods, it was $161,000 or less. And since these numbers reflect the “median” – not the “mean” (aka “average”) – that means that fully half of the homes in each neighborhood sold for less than the price listed on this map or in the bar graph.
