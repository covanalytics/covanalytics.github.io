Any event (i.e. festival, concert, run/walk, art show, etc.) that uses, or will likely have a large impact on public or City-owned property, such as streets or parks, requires a [Special Event Permit Application](https://www.covingtonky.gov/Portals/covingtonky/Government/Departments/Administration/City%20Manager's%20Office/Special%20Event%20Permit/Documents/2023%20Special%20Event%20Permit%20Application_FILLABLE.pdf?ver=ez2s7d1-IV_MgBw16wBbKQ%3d%3d).  This is information that the City of Covington requires to ensure that everything goes smoothly and safely with the event.

Some events, naturally, last longer than others.  *What kind of world would this be if we only have one day to enjoy the Rockin Taco Fest.*  The graph below shows the number of special event permits that were issued for single day events and multiple day events in the year 2022.
